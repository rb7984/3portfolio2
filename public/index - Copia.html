            <p>Hi There! My Name is Riccardo Barelli,

            <div style="padding: 5px;">I did my curricular internship in the company 3DWasp, addressing the themes of 3D printing applied to the architectural scale. During this time I was asked to develop a design for Dior's PopUp Store that would be built and presented at Expo21 in Dubai. The idea for the development of the twin pavilions is strongly focused on the identity of the brand in a dual role: the company logo is used in plan while the texture of the skin of the building refers to the images that have always adorned the company and its products</div>
